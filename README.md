A console-based Pong game built entirely in C++ using object-oriented programming principles.  

This project implements a simplified version of the classic **Pong** game.  
The player controls a paddle to hit incoming balls — each successful hit increases the score.  
As the score increases, the paddle size shrinks and more balls are introduced, making the game progressively harder.

Features

- Object-oriented design using **Ball**, **Player**, and **Screen** classes  
- Real-time console rendering  
- Simple physics with velocity and gravity  
- Difficulty scaling (shrinking paddle & multiple balls)  
- Clean separation of logic, rendering, and input

Technical Details

- **Language:** C++  
- **Concepts Used:** Classes, Objects, Methods, Game Loop, Collision Detection  
- **Build System:** `Makefile`
- **Platform:** Linux
